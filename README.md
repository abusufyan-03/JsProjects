# JsProjects

This repository is a collection of mini JavaScript projects that I’m building as part of my learning journey.

## 🚀 Learning Approach

* First, I try to **build each project on my own** without watching the course video.
* After finishing my version, I watch the **instructor’s video** to learn their approach.
* Finally, I may **refactor my code** based on new insights or better practices.

## 📂 Projects

Each project has its own folder with:

* `index.html` → project UI
* `style.css` → styling (if needed)
* `script.js` → JavaScript logic

## 🛠 Tech Stack

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript

## 📝 Notes

This repo is mainly for **practice & revision**. It’s not focused on production-ready apps but rather on experimenting, learning, and tracking progress.
